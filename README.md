# DuplicateDetection
## The project 

This project is about finding candidate pairs among TVs on Web-shops with Locality-Sensitive Hashing. We try to improve the LSH performance by including an extra step in the data cleaning process.


## What's included?

- TVs-all-merged.json: the used dataset, containing product descriptions on 1,624 TVs from four different Web-shops.
- results: folder containing the results from our new method and also the old method.
- README.md: this file.
- main_new.py: the python code that contains all methods for the paper. Run this file if you want to obtain the results.
